### Task 1:

This program:

Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument.

Calculates its factorial using a loop (or recursion).

Returns the computed factorial value.

Calls the function with a sample number and prints the result.

The factorial of a number n (written as n!) is the product of all positive integers up to n.
Example:
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120


### Task 2:

## 🔹 Program Functionality
✔ User Input

The program prompts the user to enter a numerical value.
The input is converted to a float to support both integers and decimal values.

✔ Mathematical Calculations

Using the math module:

math.sqrt(num) computes the square root

math.log(num) computes the natural logarithm (base e)

math.sin(num) computes the sine value in radians

✔ Output

The program prints the calculated:

Square root

Natural logarithm

Sine value

Each result is displayed with a clear and readable message.
