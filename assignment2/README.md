## 🧩 Task 1 – Even or Odd Number Checker

### 🧠 Functionality:
This program allows the user to enter any integer number and determines whether it is **even** or **odd**.

- It uses the **modulus operator (`%`)** to find the remainder when the number is divided by 2.  
- If the remainder is 0 → the number is **even**.  
- Otherwise → it is **odd**.

### 🧮 Example: 

## input ==> Enter a number: 10

## output  ==> 10 is an even number

## 🧮 Task 2 – Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

### 🧠 Functionality:
This program calculates the **sum of all integers from 1 to 50** using a **for loop**.

- It initializes a variable `sum = 0`.  
- Iterates through numbers 1 to 50, adding each number to `sum`.  
- Finally, it displays the **total sum (1275)**.

### 🧮 Example Output:

The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
